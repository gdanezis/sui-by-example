# Sui by Example

## Introduction

The repo contains a few examples of Sui applications written using the Rust SDK. The examples come with `README.md` files explaining step-by-step key Sui and blockchain contexts, references to more documentation, as well as instructions for configuring the environments and running them.

## Outline

- 01: How to read basic data from the Sui network.
- 02: How to read object meta-data and contents.
- 03: How to write a Move smart contract, and execute a transaction on it.
- 04: How to pass arguments to transactions and use shared objects.
- 05: How to use and read events emitted by smart contracts.
- XX: How to construct more complex Programmable Transaction Blocks.
- ... TBD ...

## Installation

You will need a working rust installation with cargo and all. You probably also need an [installation of Sui](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install) to follow after example 03.
